    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure security, scalability, and ease of debugging, in accordance with the defined principles.  Authorization Independence is achieved through denormalization. For example, the `attendance` collection denormalizes the `studentRegister` field, ensuring that attendance records can be queried and secured independently of the student document.  Structural Segregation is applied by using separate collections for `students` and `attendance`, each with specific security requirements. Access Modeling utilizes path-based ownership for student data (`/students/{registerNumber}`), and a top-level collection for `attendance` to enable efficient queries across all students. This structure supports secure `list` operations by ensuring that only authorized users can access the data within each collection, adhering to QAPs. Invariants like ownership and timestamps are enforced through security rules."
